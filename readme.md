#Ali.MD Object3D v2.2 light.
##As Simple as Possible 3D Rotation Class in Flash.
###Special tanx to Ali Vojdany for mathematical logic.

This class programmed by me when i was very Youngest.
I add it to git for save to my github history and for you.
It can help you to better understand 3D mathematical and matrix.
Flash added 3D functions to ActionScript 3 in v9 and this project was closed for ever ;)
But i stile love it and enjoy to remember that Stound ;)

Mathematical logic keep working and i port it to JavaScript.
