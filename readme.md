##As Simple as Possible Pure Native JavaScript 3D Rotation.
Ported from my **Object3D**

Original **Object3D** class (**flash branch**) programmed by me when i was very youngest.
I port it to JavaScript for fun at my weekend.
I believe it can help you to improve your skills in **JavaScript Modern Design Pattern**.

##If you have any idea or want to make fun with js *fork* it.
This class optimized for webkit and v8
please report me any bug or conflict with other modern browser.
